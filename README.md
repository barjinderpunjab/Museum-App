# Museum-App Readme file
This application is created as part of an exercise in the Master course.

Overview of the project:
We are focusing on how to easily navigate visitors not only with virtual reality but with other features as well such as using location sensing techniques used by mobile phone to identify visitors’ locations. With location sensor like beacon technology it automatically present relevant information when visitors are near the art pieces. However, this usage only contributes little to museum personalization. Purpose of our product is to maintain and increase museums relevance in today’s digital world.

This product’s aim is to include people with all kind of disabilities and provide them a unique experience. This can be achieved by creating a feature using beacon technology. Recently, beacon technology has gathered a lot of attention in the museum sector. Beacons are a location-based technology in the form of small wireless sensor. When a visitor walks in proximity of a beacon with their Bluetooth-enabled devices like a smartphone, the beacon automatically sends messages and content to the visitors’ devices. This feature will enable all type of visitors since we will give the opportunity to the user to choose of visual or audio content.


Contributors of the project:
There are two contributors on this project Barjinder Singh and Dimitra Piotogiannaki.
Barjinder's main focus will be to create the Augmented Reality virtual tour navigation, the process of notification of new exhibits and the creation of the interactive map of the museum.
Dimitra will contribute by creating the collection feature of the application. She will also focus on the social share feature, the audio guide navigation and the location sensing by beacon technology.
Both they will cooperate on creating the dictionary functionality, finalise the last details of the functionalities and do the final testing of the prototypes.

Framework:
The framework that will be used to develop the application will be Axure and the prototype will be running on all platforms (web, mobile and tablet).
It can be accessed by a link so it does not need any additional programs to be downloaded.
